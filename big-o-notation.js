// The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation
// Big-o-notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms

//characteristics- It is expressed in terms of the input
                // It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.

/**
 * Time Complexity- O(n)- Linear  --->for loops
