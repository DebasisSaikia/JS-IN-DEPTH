ALGORITHM - an algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
Features- Well defined inputs and outputs
        Each step should be clear and unambiguous
        Language independent

ALGORITHM analysis - we can evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
Time Complexity- Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
Space Complexity- Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

Represent Complexity: Asymptotic notations- 1)Big-o-notation- Worst case Complexity
                                            2) Omega notation- Best case Complexity
                                            3)Theta notation - Average case Complexity
